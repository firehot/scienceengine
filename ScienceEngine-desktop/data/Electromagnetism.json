 "description": "TutorVista - Histroy of electromagnetism from Oersted through Faraday. A voltage would be generated across a length of wire if that wire was exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field flux of changing intensity. An easy way to create a magnetic field of changing intensity is to move a permanent magnet next to a wire or coil of wire."

 "description": "Produced by the National STEM Centre and the Institute of Physics, this video demonstrates the process of electromagnetic induction. It shows a simple piece of equipment that can readily be made which contains spinning magnets, a wire coil and a lamp. Spinning the magnets past the coil produces an electric current and lights the lamp."
